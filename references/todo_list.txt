Todo Agenda list:
1. Revise and correct the graph that displays the change in calories.

2. Recreate the login structure, make sure when the user logs in, the graph automatically takes the user 
attributes and derive the correct predictions based on the users information.

3. Features to add:
	a. Search bar - AJAX/RESTful api, we need to create build commands to process .csv or pdf files into our database.
	user Pandas to solve this issue.
	b. Low AI for predicting the next increment of for ex: workout A/B and their explicit attained goals.(100 the following +5 = 105)
	c. Need to research Calendar API, tag Norman for this.
	d. Total calories checker, based on a total amount of calories and selected preffered foods the user selects. We can 
	automatically distinguish which type of meals or foods the user 'liked' and remove suggested meals that the user 'dislikes'.
	e. Possibly a human Man/Woman body chart displaying the current body 'look' the user have. Sensitive data will only be viewed by the user.
